Flight Booking Price Prediction



Overview:
This project uses machine learning to predict flight booking prices based on features such as days_left, duration, and airline. The analysis identifies key factors affecting flight prices and demonstrates the use of explainable AI techniques like SHAP to interpret the model's predictions.

Branches-
main: Contains the fully documented version of the project, including explanations, visualizations, and insights.


Key Features:
Predicts flight prices using machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Incorporates cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.
Utilizes SHAP to provide explainable AI insights into feature importance.

Results:
The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with an RÂ² score of 0.61.
Key features like days_left and duration were identified as the most influential factors in determining flight prices.

Future Work:
Include business and first-class flight data for broader generalizability.
Explore additional features such as ticket purchase platforms.
Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
